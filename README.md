## 📂 Projects
Here are some of my projects, created throughout my school year:

- [Guessing Game in C](https://github.com/A-Yologlu/Guessing-Game)  
  In my first quarter I learned about the basics of C, aswell as: arrays, strings, loops, sorting, conditionals. 

- [Rock paper scissors](https://github.com/A-Yologlu/Rock-Paper-Scissors)  
  A small rock paper scissors game with a points system, using loops.

- [Calculator in C](https://github.com/A-Yologlu/Calculator)  
  A command-line calculator that supports basic operations. Learned to create my own functions.

Each project reflects what I learned during that quarter — applying new programming concepts in practice.
*(More projects coming soon as I learn!)*
